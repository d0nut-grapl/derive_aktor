# derive_aktor
A macro to generate Rust actors

This library is currently unstable, and in progress. It does not generate *any* code, it simply prints out some of the code it would generate.

The goals are laid out here: https://github.com/insanitybit/aktors/issues/2

Essentially, the goal is to allow you to write simple, synchronous rust structs and then, given only some macro annotations, generate an Actor
version of that struct. The Actor will handle dispatching events to your underlying, synchronous code. And this will all happen
using strongly typed, compile time generated interfaces.

# Goals
    * Generate enum from impl function types (Done)
    * Generate Actor structure (Done)
    * Generate Actor Impl (Done)
    * Generate 'route_message' impl (Done)
    * Support generics (In Progress - no support for Where Clauses currently)
    * Automate return values being handled by closures
    * Actors from Traits

With the current state of the crate, the following code is representative of the experience using this library:


```rust
struct PrintLogger {
    
}

#[derive_aktor]
impl PrintLogger {
    pub fn info(data: String) {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }

    pub fn error(data: String) {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}

// Code from this point forward is generated by the derive_actor macro above

// Union type representing functions and their arguments of hte underlying PrintLogger
PrintLoggerMessage {
    Info {
        data: String
    },
    Error {
        data: String
    }
}

// The actual Actor, which will send messages to the underlying PrintLogger
struct PrintLoggerActor {
    sender: Sender<PrintLoggerMessage>,
    receiver: Receiver<PrintLoggerMessage>,
    id: String
}

// This impl will provide an identical API to the impl for the underlying PrintLogger, as well as a
// 'new' function, which will take an execution handle and an already constructed PrintLogger
impl PrintLoggerActor {
    pub fn new(handle: Handle, actor: PrintLogger) -> PrintLoggerActor {
        let (sender, receiver) = channel::new();
        let id = "random string".to_owned();

        let recvr = receiver.clone();
        
        handle.spawn(futures::lazy(move || {
            loop_fn(0, move |_| match recvr.try_recv() {
                Ok(msg) => {
                    actor.route_message(msg);

                    Ok::<_, _>(Loop::Continue(0))
                }
                Err(TryRecvError::Disconnected) => Ok::<_, _>(Loop::Break(())),
                Err(TryRecvError::Empty) => Ok::<_, _>(Loop::Continue(0)),
            })
        }));

        PrintLoggerActor {
            sender: sender,
            receiver: receiver,
            id: id
        }
    }
    
    pub fn info(data: String) {
        let msg = PrintLoggerMessage::Info { data: data };
        self.sender.send(msg);
    }

    pub fn error(data: String) {
        let msg = PrintLoggerMessage::Error { data: data };
        self.sender.send(msg);
    }
}

// We lastly generate the route_message function, which deconstructs our message and routes it to
// the underlying function
impl PrintLogger {
    pub fn route_message(&mut self, msg: PrintLoggerMessage) {
        match msg {
            PrintLoggerMessage::Info(data: data) => self.info(data),
            PrintLoggerMessage::Error(data: data) => self.error(data),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let system = ThreadPoolExecutor::with_thread_count(2).unwrap();
    let logger = PrintLogger{};

    let log_actor = PrintLoggerActor::new(system.handle(), logger);

    // These two functions return immediately
    // None of our written code had to use threads or fibers or futures or anything,
    // concurrency for free.
    
    log_actor.info("info log");
    log_actor.error("error!!");

    system.run();
}```

You would then generate FooActor's, rather than Foo's, but you would work with a very similar interface.
